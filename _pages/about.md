Hello there!

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Econometrics at the 
[Swiss Institute for Empirical Economic Research](https://sew.unisg.ch/) 
of the University of St. Gallen. My supervisor is 
[Beatrix Eugster](https://www.beatrixeugster.ch/).

Prior to that I worked as a data analyst at Raiffeisen, a large retail bank in
Switzerland. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Economics and my Master's
degree in Quantitative Economics and Finance from the University of St. Gallen.
During my studies, I also worked as a research assistant for professor
[Charles Gottlieb](https://sites.google.com/site/gottliebcharles/Charles-Gottlieb) 
and professor [Beatrix Eugster](https://www.beatrixeugster.ch/).

I have extensive experience in curating, analysing and visualizing data, as
well as programming in general. I am also enthusiastic about the development
and application of econometric methods.
